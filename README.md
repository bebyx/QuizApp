# QuizApp
QuizApp is a complete project of a quiz app (not including content).
It consists of three activities: StartActivity, QuestionsActivity, ResultActivity.

The initial StartActivity sends to the QuestionsActivity, where a user needs to choose a preferred variant from three options, every of 7 questions are offering.
The variants are shuffled programmatically.

Once the user goes through all questions, the app sends to the ResultActivity, which provides the result upon the choices done previously. 
The displayed text may be shared via device's social media apps, messengers, etc.

*Now working on implementing a custom class for Scoring.*
